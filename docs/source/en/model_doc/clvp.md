# CLVP

## Overview

The CLVP(Contrastive Language-Voice Pretrained Transformer) model was proposed in [Better speech synthesis through scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07243) by James Betker.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In recent years, the field of image generation has been revolutionized by the appli-
cation of autoregressive transformers and DDPMs. These approaches model the
process of image generation as a step-wise probabilistic processes and leverage
large amounts of compute and data to learn the image distribution.
This methodology of improving performance need not be confined to images. This
paper describes a way to apply advances in the image generative domain to speech
synthesis. The result is TorToise - an expressive, multi-voice text-to-speech sys-
tem.*

Tips:

1. CLVP or Contrastive Language-Voice Pretrained Transformer is an integral part of the `tortoise-tts` system.
2. In `tortoise-tts`, CLVP is used to compare different generated speech token candidates (generated by the 
auto-regressive transformer model) with the provided text, and the best speech tokens are forwarded to the diffuser model.
3. Since the conversion of text to text-tokens is done by `tortoise-tts` tokenizer, we don't have any tokenizer implemented
for CLVP. In addition to that, the speech tokens are generated by the auto-regressive transformer model thus leaving us 
with a stand alone model without any tokenizer or feature-extractor.
4. If you want to use this architecture for your model/custom pipeline please don't forget about the tokenizer.
